**ðŸš€ Roadmap to \$10K/Month: RescuePC Repairs Toolkit**

### Immediate Technical Priorities:

1. **Resolve Critical Test Failures:**
   - **Bot Detection Scoring:**
     - Adjust `getBotScore` logic to align with expected thresholds (`>0.5`, `>0.3`, `>0.6`).

   - **AuthFortress Authentication:**
     - Ensure mocked functions (`jsonwebtoken`, `bcrypt`) are correctly utilized.
     - Correctly handle authentication logic, MFA validation, and token rotation.

   - **Middleware Response Fix:**
     - Correctly return response objects with status codes (`403`, `429`) on failures.

   - **File and Input Validation:**
     - Fix edge cases (`null` inputs, SQL injection handling, correct magic number validation).

   - **Logging Infrastructure:**
     - Automatically create log directories before tests run to avoid ENOENT errors.

### Strategic Monetization Steps:

**Phase 1: Product Stabilization & Initial Monetization (Days 1-14)**

- Complete immediate test and CI/CD fixes.
- Fully operational Stripe webhook and licensing system.
- Deploy Gumroad or Stripe checkout for immediate income.
- Initial soft-launch: Reddit, IndieHackers, Twitter.

**Phase 2: Scaling and Growth (Days 15-30)**

- Implement automated email capture and nurture sequences.
- Launch viral Notion-based lead magnets (Repair Checklists, Optimization Guides).
- Affiliate/referral program deployed.
- Targeted Cold outreach scripts deployed (Reddit, LinkedIn automation).

**Phase 3: Cashflow Stacking & Automation (Days 31-45)**

- Add subscription-based premium content or recurring revenue stream.
- Deploy high-ticket enterprise licenses (\$500+/license).
- Activate AI-driven customer support and onboarding to reduce operational overhead.
- Establish automated monitoring and alerts (Slack/Email) for license purchases and renewals.

**Revenue Milestones:**

- Day 14: \$1K/month (Initial traction)
- Day 30: \$5K/month (Growth phase)
- Day 45: \$10K/month (Scale and automate)

### âœ… **What's Immediately Next:**

- **Next Technical Action:** Fix bot detection scoring thresholds to pass the immediate failing tests.
- **Next Monetization Action:** Deploy initial paid checkout funnel and license endpoint, ensuring CI/CD pipeline stability.

Let's execute these actions next!
