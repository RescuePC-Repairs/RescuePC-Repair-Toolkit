            Hi, I'm Tyler, a 24-year-old Computer Science student with a passion for building
            high-performance systems. With 6+ years of experience in Windows repair and
            optimization, I've created RescuePC Repairs with military-grade security standards.
            <br />
            <br />
            Every line of code is designed for maximum security, scalability, and performance. This
            enterprise infrastructure can handle millions of users while maintaining the highest
            security standards.
            <br />
            <br />
            After fixing hundreds of computers and seeing the same problems repeatedly, I thought to
            myself: "There had to be a better way." What started as a personal project to streamline
            my own repair process has evolved into RescuePC Repairsâ€”a comprehensive toolkit that
            makes professional Windows repair accessible to everyone.
