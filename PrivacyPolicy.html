        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p class="important">LAST UPDATED: June 8, 2025</p>
        <p>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how RescuePC Repairs Toolkit ("Company," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects information in connection with the RescuePC Repairs software and related services (the "Service"), which includes our website, software, and support channels.</p>
        <p class="important">Please read this policy carefully to understand our practices regarding your information.</p>

        <h2>1. INFORMATION WE DO NOT COLLECT (The Software)</h2>
        <p>The core functionality of the RescuePC Repairs software is designed to work entirely offline. The software itself does not collect, store, transmit, or report any personal data, usage information, or system details from your computer. It operates locally and performs repairs without sending any information over the internet.</p>

        <div class="important">
            <strong>Important Note:</strong> RescuePC Repairs is an offline tool that runs locally on your computer. We do not have access to, collect, or process any personal data from your system. The only personal data we receive is what you provide during the payment process through Stripe.
        </div>

        <h2>2. INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT (Website & Support)</h2>
        <p>While the software is offline, we may collect limited information when you interact with our website or contact us for support:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Information You Provide:</strong> We collect information you voluntarily provide to us when you purchase the software (handled via Stripe), contact customer support via email, or join our community channels (like Discord, subject to Discord's privacy policy). This may include your name, email address, payment information (processed by Stripe), and the content of your communications.</li>
            <li><strong>Website Usage Data:</strong> We use standard tools to collect non-personally identifiable information about how visitors use our website, such as browser type, operating system, referring pages, and visit duration. This data is aggregated and used to improve the website, not to identify individuals.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. HOW WE USE INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect from the website and support channels for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To process your purchase and deliver the software download and license key</li>
            <li>To provide customer support and respond to your inquiries</li>
            <li>To communicate with you about your purchase or support requests</li>
            <li>To maintain and improve our website and services</li>
            <li>To comply with legal obligations</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties. We may share your information only in the following limited circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We use trusted third-party services to process payments (Stripe) and manage email communications. These providers only receive the information necessary to perform their services and are obligated to protect your information.</li>
            <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court order or government agency request).</li>
            <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. DATA SECURITY</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the information collected via our website and support channels from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no internet transmission or electronic storage is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h2>6. THIRD-PARTY LINKS</h2>
        <p>Our website may contain links to third-party websites or services, such as Stripe for payments or Discord for our community. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these third parties. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party sites you visit.</p>

        <h2>7. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h2>
        <p>Our Service is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information.</p>

        <h2>8. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page with a new "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Your continued use of the Service after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
