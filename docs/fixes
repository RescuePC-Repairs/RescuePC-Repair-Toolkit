# 🛠️ Website Issues Fixed - RescuePC Repairs

## 🔧 Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Hyphenation Problems**
**Problem**: Headings like "What You Get - Complete PC Repair Toolkit" and "Why Choose RescuePC Repairs?" were experiencing unwanted hyphenation due to CSS `hyphens: auto` property.

**Root Cause**: 
- Global CSS rule: `* { hyphens: auto; }` was applying automatic hyphenation to ALL elements
- Responsive text breaking rules were too aggressive for headings

**✅ Fixed**:
- Changed global hyphenation to `hyphens: none`
- Added specific rules for headings: `h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { hyphens: none !important; word-break: keep-all; }`
- Separated heading behavior from paragraph text breaking
- Maintained proper text overflow handling without unwanted hyphenation

### 2. **Section Clicking Behavior Issues**
**Problem**: Sections acting "weird once clicked" due to conflicting event handlers and CSS properties.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- JavaScript smooth scroll handler with `e.preventDefault()` on ALL anchor links
- Potential interference between FAQ click handlers and section navigation
- Event propagation conflicts between mobile menu and section clicks

**✅ Solutions Applied**:
- Event handlers are properly scoped (only FAQ questions have click handlers)
- Smooth scroll only prevents default on actual anchor links (`a[href^="#"]`)
- No conflicting `pointer-events` or `user-select` properties on section content
- Mobile menu click handlers properly contained with event bubbling controls

### 3. **Typography & Responsive Design Improvements**
**Enhanced**:
- Headings now use `word-break: keep-all` to prevent unwanted breaking
- Maintained responsive behavior without hyphenation
- Improved text overflow handling for long titles
- Better mobile responsiveness for section headings
